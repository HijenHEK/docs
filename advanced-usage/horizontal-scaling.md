# â†” Horizontal Scaling

soketi is optimized to work in multi-node or multi-process environments, like Kubernetes or PM2, where horizontal scalability is one of the main core features that can be built upon. The main concern when scaling horizontally is **how can I make the nodes communicate between them?**

To be able to scale it horizontally and efficiently enable node-to-node or process-to-process communication, soketi leverages a Redis connection.

You can configure soketi to run with Redis as a primary adapter for the local-persistent data with an environment variable:

```
$ ADAPTER_DRIVER=redis soketi start
```
