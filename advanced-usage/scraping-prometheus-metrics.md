# ðŸ“ˆ Scraping Prometheus Metrics

You can enable the server to expose a `/metrics` endpoint at the given `6001` port by using the `METRICS_ENABLED` environment variable.

```bash
METRICS_ENABLED=1 pws-server start
```

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:6001/metrics
```

This is just a trimmed output. The exposed metrics are for both pWS connections and apps, as well as the Node.js built-in Prometheus metrics regarding the running processes, memory and CPU usage that can be quite useful for autoscaling or monitoring the running instance.
