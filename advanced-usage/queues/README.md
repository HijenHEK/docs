# ðŸ•› Queues

Queues can be used to defer some code from running in the current WebSocket server. This feature is useful for queuing Webhook's HTTP requests in a different process so that it won't interfere with the WebSockets server. The default queue driver is `sync` and it will run in the same process as the current server.
