soketi is meant to be free, forever. Having a good companion for developing real-time applications locally and in production should not involve any third-party and having a reliable websocket server to deploy behind a firewall makes soketi a compelling option for many applications.

Of course, like many open source software solutions, development is done by investing volunteer time into the project. Therefore, all donations are greatly appreciated. You can sponsor the development via [Github Sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/rennokki).
