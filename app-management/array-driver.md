# ðŸ§¬Array Driver

The default driver is called `array`. This is a static array in-memory that is kept while the uWS Server process is running. Whenever a connection is made or an event is broadcasted, the app credentials will be checked using this method.

[You should use the `DEFAULT_APP_*` variables to set the default app details.](../environment-variables/available-environment-variables/app-management.md#default-application)
