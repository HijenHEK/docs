# ðŸ’¿ Environment Variables

You may declare the parameters using environment variables directly passed in the CLI or at the OS level, or as key-value attributes in an `.env` file that is placed at the location from where the command is being run.

For example, either by running the command with injected variables at the CLI level or having an .env file with declared variables is either a good way.

A lot of features can be enabled using environment variables. The specific variable files to use are explained on each documentation section.

You can be injecting them at the CLI level:

```bash
DEBUG=1 soketi start
```

Having a separate .env file:

```
# Within your .env file
SOKETI_DEBUG=1
```

```
soketi start
```
