# ðŸ’» Backend Configuration

The backend configuration of your real-time messaging infrastructure will depend on the language of your application. However, in this example we will demonstrate configuration the Pusher PHP SDK to interact with soketi, which should be similar to the configuration of server-side Pusher SDKs in other languages:

```php
use Pusher\Pusher;

$pusher = new Pusher('app-key', 'app-secret', 'app-id', [
    'host' => '127.0.0.1',
    'port' => 6001,
    'scheme' => 'http',
    'encrypted' => true,
    'useTLS' => false,
]);
```

{% hint style="info" %}
To configure the client for [SSL](../ssl-configuration.md), you should set the `scheme` option to `http` and the `useTLS` option to `true`
{% endhint %}
